---

### **Pre-requisites:**

* You'll need a card(mastercard or verve) to verify your account. Your Nigerian card should work as long as you've enabled internet banking.
    
* A laptop and your browser.
    
* Willingness to learn**.**
    

### **Setting Up Your Account**

First, go to [https://signup.cloud.oracle.com/](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com/)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759289519830/ee271b9c-0bc4-4bac-9649-3c794d8e35b3.png align="center")

1. Input your details.
    
2. A verification link will be sent to your email.
    
3. Click the link. It'll take you to the signup page where you'll be asked to input other details.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759289593979/13e3f629-a456-466f-a0e1-b52a4f0c69c1.png align="center")

4. Under Account type, select "Individual".
    
5. For Cloud Account name, you can come up with any name you like.
    
6. Home region: When selecting a home region, pick the one that's closest to you. You can only get the free server in your home region. You really don't want to choose a distant region, or the server will be super slow. So, go on Google or use AI to ask for the closest region to your location.
    
7. Next, you'll be taken to a page where you need to input your address.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759289888288/b34058b9-6dfd-4c9b-ae10-2404c9780373.png align="center")

8. Scroll down and add your payment details.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759290096446/2470c076-5091-4051-b183-212aca928b30.png align="center")

You won't be charged, but you need to have at least 0.93 Euros in your account for the verification hold.

Yes, you can use your Naira card. You can't use a virtual card. Use your normal bank Mastercard or Visa card. As long as you've opted in for internet banking, you shouldn't have any issues.

Once that's done, you should see this page and even if that isn’t the page you see, it’s not an issue:

### **Upgrading the Account**

The next step is to **upgrade your account**. Don't worry, you won't be charged.

The main reason we have to upgrade is so we can create the **free resources**. If you don't upgrade to a paid account, you won't be able to create the free server without running into an error.

* **You need at least 93 Euros in your account**. Again, don't worry, you will not be charged. They just check for a high enough limit.
    

Now, let's upgrade the account.

1. Click the **menu** icon.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759290633351/fba8ab29-7ac1-48e2-b51a-1fc9d105d5ca.png align="center")
    

2. In the search bar, search **"upgrade"** and select **"Upgrade and Manage Payment"**.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759290784225/c22e754f-4bfb-425d-a24c-627f96eb80e3.png align="center")
    

3. Scroll down and you'll see a button to upgrade. Click it.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759292910348/8e796a4a-bd08-4fa3-8e66-e09e2c0d7ba6.png align="center")
    

*The reason you're not seeing an upgrade button in my screenshot is because I have already upgraded my account.*

It usually takes some time to upgrade. They'll send an email once your account has been **upgraded**. Once that email hits your inbox, we can now create the free server.

### **How to Create the Free Server (Compute Instance)**

1. Go to the menu. In the search bar, search for "instance" and select it.

You'll be taken to this page where it shows that the server is **provisioning**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759293962818/612587a9-8559-46c1-a4d8-8ccf71384e79.png align="center")

### **Getting the IP Address**

Once it's provisioned, select "Details". What we're looking for is the IP address. If you can find yours there, copy it. If you can't, I'll show you how we can get it.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759294271276/f47f7bf8-1454-4385-b8d4-240a54325eea.png align="center")

1. Select the Networking Tab, and scroll down to the "Attached VNIC" section. Click on the attached VNIC.  
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759294360355/491c7057-0375-43c5-a30f-4833cdb69f88.png align="center")

2. Click on "IP Administration". Click on the 3 dots near the IP you see there and select "Edit".  
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759294821571/5d808b52-d549-4f61-8b84-7f19b6963b11.png align="center")

    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759295211205/95a2ac5c-2b73-4d6e-8c37-2d48e717b27b.png align="center")
    
4. Next, click on "Instances" on the left-hand side. Then, go to "Details". You should now see the IP address. Copy it.

### **Connecting to the Server (SSH)**

The next step is to **SSH into our server** and set up Coolify.

This is the general format for how to SSH into a server hosted on Oracle:

```plaintext
ssh -i /path/to/your/private_key_file ubuntu@ipaddress
```

Let's say the private key I downloaded when setting up my server is in my Downloads folder, and my IP address is 150.230.54.253. This is how I will SSH into my server:

```plaintext
ssh -i ./Downloads/oracle-ssh-key-2025-09-16.key ubuntu@150.230.54.253
```

I'll show you how I do mine. I open my terminal.

First, I give the private key file some **restricted access**. If I don't, I won't be able to SSH into my server. To do that, I use this command:

```plaintext
chmod 600 /path/to/your/private_key_file
```

When I tried to SSH into my server, because it's a new IP address, I was asked to add the fingerprint. I simply type "yes" into the terminal and hit the enter key.

After that, I'm able to successfully log into my server. The next step is to install Coolify.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759296066627/73a2c1d8-1dd9-4d44-b0df-5af96ef5b5b8.png align="center")

### **Installing Coolify and N8N**

**Coolify** is what we'll use to install and manage N8N on our server.

1. Copy and paste this into your terminal:
    

```plaintext
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

&lt;11&gt;

2. Once you see this screen, it means you've successfully installed Coolify.  
    &lt;12&gt;
    
3. Open your browser and go to your **&lt;public ip address&gt;:8000**. In my case, it's [http://45.79.198.154:8000](http://45.79.198.154:8000).
    
4. You'll see this page. Input your details and register.  
    &lt;13&gt;
    
5. This is what you'll see when you've successfully registered.  
    &lt;14&gt;
    
6. Now, go to 'Projects' and click on 'Add' a new project.  
    &lt;15&gt;
    
7. After adding a new project, click on 'Production', then click 'Add a new resource'.  
    &lt;16&gt;
    
8. Search for N8N in the console and select 'N8N with postgresql'.  
    &lt;17&gt;
    
9. Before deploying, there are a few things we have to edit. First, click on this link and edit it. Remove the colon and the numbers in front (e.g., change domain:8000 to domain).  
    &lt;18&gt;-&lt;21&gt;
